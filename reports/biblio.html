<p>The importance of mutation identification for advanced colorectal cancer treatment with anti- epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) agents is well established. However, due to delays in turnaround time, low-quality tissue samples, and/or lack of standardization of testing methods a significant proportion of patients are being treated without the information that KRAS and NRAS testing can provide. The detection of mutated circulating tumor DNA by BEAMing technology addresses this gap in care and allows these patients to receive international guideline-recommended expanded RAS testing with rapid turnaround times. Furthermore, the overall concordance between OncoBEAM RAS CRC testing and standard of care tissue testing is very high (93.3%). This article presents an overview of the clinical utility and potential applications of this minimally-invasive method, such as early detection of emergent resistance to anti-EGFR therapy. If appropriately implemented, BEAMing technology holds considerable promise to enhance the quality of patient care and improve clinical outcomes.</p>

<p>Brain metastasis is a serious complication of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) affecting up to 40% of NSCLC patients. A subset of NSCLC tumors has mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene, and determination of tumor EGFR mutation status is essential in guiding treatment decisions, as it directly affects the treatment approach. Patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC have a higher cumulative incidence of brain metastases, and are especially sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Patients with newly diagnosed EGFR-mutated lung cancer presenting to a neurosurgeon with a new diagnosis of brain metastases now have a variety of treatment options available, including whole brain radiation therapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, surgical resection, chemotherapy, and targeted therapeutics such as the EGFR TKIs. In this review, we discuss the impact of EGFR mutation status on brain and leptomeningeal metastasis treatment considerations. Additionally, we present clinical cases of patients treated with EGFR TKIs alone and in combination with other therapies to highlight treatment alternatives.</p>

<p>EGFR mutations cause inconsistent response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). To better understand these features, we reviewed all cases of EGFR -mutated NSCLC collected in the Biomarkers France database.</p>

<p>Icotinib has been previously shown to be non-inferior to gefitinib in non-selected advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients when given as second- or further-line treatment. In this open-label, randomized, phase 3 CONVINCE trial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of first-line icotinib versus cisplatin/pemetrexed plus pemetrexed maintenance in lung adenocarcinoma patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation.</p>

<p>Mutations in rat sarcoma ( RAS) genes may be a mechanism of secondary resistance in EGFR inhibitor-treated patients. Tumor-tissue biopsy testing has been the standard for evaluating mutational status; however, plasma testing of cell-free DNA has been shown to be a more sensitive method for detecting clonal evolution.</p>
