<p>Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) gefitinib has demonstrated dramatic clinical efficacy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, its therapeutic efficacy is ultimately limited by the development of acquired drug resistance. The aim of this study was to explore the potential utility of chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1) inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB) in combination with gefitinib to overcome primary and acquired gefitinib resistance in NSCLC cells. The combinative effects of gefitinib and LMB were evaluated by MTT and its underlining mechanism was assessed by flow cytometry and Western blot. LMB displayed a synergistic effect on gefitinib-induced cytotoxicity in A549 (IC50: 25.02.1M of gefitinib+LMB vs. 32.02.5M of gefitinib alone, p<0.05). Gefitinib+LMB caused a significantly different cell cycle distribution and signaling pathways involving in EGFR/survivin/p21 compared with gefitinib. A549 cells then were treated with progressively increasing concentrations of gefitinib (A549GR) or in combination with LMB (A549GLR) over 10months to generate gefitinib resistance. IC50 of gefitinib in A549GLR (37.02.8M) was significantly lower than that in A549GR (53.03.0M, p<0.05), which indicates that LMB could reverse gefitinib-induced resistance in A549. Further mechanism investigation revealed that the expression patterns of EGFR pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in A549, A549GR, and A549GLR were significantly different. In conclusion, LMB at a very low concentration combined with gefitinib showed synergistic therapeutic effects and ameliorated the development of gefitinib-induced resistance in lung cancer cells.</p>

<p>Herein, we have reported the synthesis of 18 novel 8-substituted tryptanthrin analogues based on our earlier work. All these tryptanthrin analogues were well characterized by (1)H &(13)C NMR, FT-IR, Mass Spectrometry and Elemental Analysis. All these 8-substituted analogues were screened for their anti-oxidant activity by DPPH radical scavenging assay. Out of all the tested compounds, T(11), T(12), T(17) and T(18) showed potent anti-oxidant activity. The anti-cancer activity have been performed by using MTT assay protocol and their results depicts that compounds having the 4-pyridyl or 4-carboxyphenyl substituents at the 8th position of the tryptanthrin framework are found to be the most promising cytotoxic agent against A549, MCF-7 and HeLa human cancer cell lines compared to others as well as with the standard drug cisplatin. Moreover, the comparative molecular docking studies against the three protein receptors IDO1, EGFR and HER2 strongly suggested that IDO1 is the best target protein, which exhibits lowest binding energies of -11.73 and -11.61kcalmol(-1) for T(11) and T(12) scaffolds, respectively towards the in vitro anti-cancer activity.</p>
