Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been used in mutation detection of colorectal cancer (CRC). We here interrogated 747 CRC samples to detect mutations in 22 cancer-related genes by using NGS, and to explore some key challenges related to tumor biology. RAS mutations (KRAS or NRAS mutations), RAS/BRAF/PIK3CA mutations (mutations in KRAS, NRAS, BRAF or PIK3CA) and mutation burden (mutations in any of the 22 detected genes) were observed in 53.0% (396/747), 57.1% (431/747) and 84.2% (629/747) of specimens, respectively. Higher mutation frequencies were observed in biopsy specimens with  20% tumor cellularity than those with < 20% tumor cellularity, but these differences were not observed in resection samples. Intratumor mutational heterogeneity was estimated by mutant allele frequency and tumor cellularity, and more likely to occur in PIK3CA mutant tumors. No significant differences of mutation frequencies were detected between primary and metastatic tumors. Additionally, specimens after chemotherapy showed lower mutation frequencies compared with specimens without chemotherapy. Together, our findings demonstrate that poor tumor cellularity, tumor heterogeneity and adjuvant therapy may confound the molecular diagnosis of CRC, and should be highlighted with prospective quality assessment during tissue process.

We report two cases of fibrous histiocytoma (FH) associated with discrete nodular aggregates of Langerhans cells (LCs) resembling Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). In addition, the LCs showed positivity for BRAF V600E immunohistochemistry, a finding reported in neoplastic but not reactive LCs (1) . To our knowledge, these cases represent the first published association of FH and LCH. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
